  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
  .
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.
  .
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  .
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  .
    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  .
    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  .
    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  .
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.
  .
    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.
  .
    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.
  .
    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
  .
    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.
  .
    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.
  .
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  .
            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  .
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  .
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  .
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  .
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.
  .
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.
  .
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  .
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  .
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  .
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  .
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  .
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.
  .
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
      root function must still compute square roots.)
  .
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  .
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.
  .
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  .
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  .
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  .
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.
  .
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.
  .
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  .
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  .
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  .
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  .
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  .
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  .
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.
  .
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
  of these things:
  .
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
      to use the modified definitions.)
  .
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
  .
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
      least three years, to give the same user the materials
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
      than the cost of performing this distribution.
  .
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.
  .
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  .
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.
  .
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  .
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
  .
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
      Sections above.
  .
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  .
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  .
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.
  .
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  .
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
  .
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  .
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  .
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  .
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.
  .
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  .
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  .
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.
  .
                  NO WARRANTY
  .
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  .
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
  .
               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  .
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).
  .
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  .
      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  .
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
  .
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
      Lesser General Public License for more details.
  .
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  .
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  .
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  .
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  That's all there is to it!
